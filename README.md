# **Skin Pack Generator guide**

# A simple guide on how to make a custom skin pack for From The Fog!

1. Before we begin you're gonna need node.js which can be downloaded [**HERE**](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. Run "setup.bat". (**WARNING** THIS WILL RESET ANYTHING IN THE INPUT FOLDER. DO THE STEPS IN ORDER!)

3. Go to "input/skins" and change the skins to whatever you want. (You **CANNOT** make custom models with this skin pack generator. If you want to change the models of your skins you will need to download [**THIS**](https://cdn.lunareclipse.studio/zips/From-The-Fog-Custom-Skin-Template.zip) and follow the instructions.)

4. Open "input/details.json" and choose a name for your skinpack and it's skins. This is where you also need to define which skins are wide/slim.

5. Run "createPack.bat" and your skin pack will popout right before your eyes! (If you don't have "createPack.bat" you didn't follow these steps in order.)

6. If you want to show off your work feel free to post it in "#addon-showcase" in our [**Official Discord**!](https://discord.lunareclipse.studio)

## **Tips**

- Erase any parts of the normal skin that you make emissive.

- Use "/function watching:events/sightings/creeping" and look behind you to test the skins.
